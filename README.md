# cmdlist

A cross platform cli program to help keep track of commands.


# Examples
cmdlist -h
cmdlist -q cargo
cmdlist -q cargo -d true -g true

# Notes
The crate colored, used to color output does not play nicely with Git Bash in Windows Terminal, or Git Bash in the VSCode terminal.
If using Git Bash without the Windows 'wrapper' the output works as expected.
